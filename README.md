- **üîê User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in securely using Firebase Authentication.
- **‚úÖ Task Management:** Add new tasks, mark them as completed, or delete them as needed.
- **üîÑ Real-time Updates:** Tasks are synchronized in real-time across all logged-in devices thanks to Firebase Realtime Database.
- **üì± Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes, making it accessible from desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Usage

To use this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aremstrom/Todo_Sveltkit.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
   ```bash
   cd todo-list
   npm install # or yarn
   ```

3. **Obtaining Firebase Configuration**

   To set up Firebase Authentication and Database services for this project, you need to create a Firebase project and obtain your Firebase configuration.

   ### Steps to Obtain Firebase Configuration:

   1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
      - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
      - Click on "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new Firebase project.
   
   2. **Enable Authentication:**
      - In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Authentication" section.
      - Enable the authentication methods you want to use (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In, etc.).
   
   3. **Enable Firestore Database:**
      - In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Firestore Database" section.
      - Click on "Create database" and choose the appropriate location and mode for your database.
   
   4. **Obtain Firebase Configuration:**
      - In the Firebase Console, go to the project settings.
      - Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and click on the "Web" icon (</>).
      - Register your app by providing a nickname (e.g., "ToDoListApp").
      - Copy the Firebase configuration object provided (it should look like a JavaScript object).

   ### Setting up Environment Variables:

   Once you have obtained your Firebase configuration, you need to set up environment variables in your SvelteKit project to securely store this information.

   1. **Create a `.env` File:**
      - In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `.env`.

   2. **Add Firebase Configuration as Environment Variables:**
      - Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
      - Add the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your Firebase configuration values:
        ```plaintext
        VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        ```

   ### Example Firebase Configuration:

   Here's an example of how your Firebase configuration might look:

   ```javascript
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
   };
   ```

   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"`, `"YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"`, etc., with the actual values obtained from your Firebase project.

4. Start the development server.
   ```bash
   npm run dev # or yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.
